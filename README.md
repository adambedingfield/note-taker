# Note Taker<br>
## Description<br>
Note Taker is a simple yet effective note taking website. The user inputs a note title and note description, hits the save button and the note is saved to a column on the left. The notes can be clicked on to view and will stay there even if a user closes the page. A delete button also appears next to the note for users to remove no longer needed notes.<br>
